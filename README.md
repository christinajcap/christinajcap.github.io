# Making a Personal Website Readme

## Steps:
- Make # christinajcap.github.io
- When you make a new repository on github, it will make you set the origin as that repository using `git init` and other stuff lol.
- need index.html 
- to add changes to files / new files to git version, do `git add .` for everything or `git add <filename>` for a specific file
- when you're ready to put all the changes to a version, use `git commit -m "<name>"`
- to release this version (commit) to the world, do `git push origin main` , where main is the branch we are on for now, and origin is the source we are releasing to
